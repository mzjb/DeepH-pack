Prepare the dataset
==============================

To perform efficient *ab initio* electronic structure calculation by DeepH method 
for a class of large-scale material systems, one needs to design an appropriate 
dataset of small structures that have close chemical bonding environment with 
the target large-scale material systems. Therefore, the first step of a DeepH 
study is to perform the DFT calculation on the above dataset to get the DFT 
Hamiltonian matrices with the localized basis. DeepH-pack supports DFT
results made by ABACUS, OpenMX, FHI-aims or SIESTA, and will support HONPAS
soon.

Using ABACUS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One needs to perform the DFT calculation with ABACUS
to get the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian output file in the csr
format. This output file should be placed in a separate
folder for each structure in the dataset. In order to get
this csr file, the input file of ABACUS should include
keywords like this::

    out_mat_hs2   1

Using OpenMX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One needs to perform the DFT calculation with OpenMX 
to get the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian output file in a binary 
form. This binary file should be placed in a separate 
folder for each structure in the dataset and should be 
named as ``openmx.scfout``. In order to get this binary file, 
the input file of OpenMX should include keywords like this::

    System.Name   openmx
    HS.fileout    On

Besides, it is required to attach the text output of 
``openmx.out`` to the end of ``openmx.scfout``, which 
means to run::

    cat openmx.out >> openmx.scfout

Using FHI-aims
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One needs to perform the DFT calculation with modified FHI-aims
to get the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian output file in text
format. This output file should be placed in a separate
folder for each structure in the dataset.

Using SIESTA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One needs to perform DFT calculation with SIESTA to get Hamiltonians in binary
file named ``${System_name}.HSX``. To activate this feature, you should include 
keyword in ``${System_name}.fdf`` file::

    SaveHS true

It is also recommended to specify a higher convergence criteria for SCF calculation.
We found it sufficient to write in ``${System_name}.fdf`` file::

    DM.Tolerence  1.d-9
